## **A Modern, Lightweight HUD for Everyone (Free & Open Source)**
This is a simple hud made for fun and something to post for free, it lacks features but looks nice and good for servers going for a simple look, I haven't tested this on any resolution/aspect ratio other then 1920x1080 16:9, so it may not work on other resolutions good. 

- **Supported Frameworks:** [ESX](https://github.com/esx-framework/esx_core/tree/main/%5Bcore%5D), [QB](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-core), [QBOX](https://github.com/Qbox-project/qbx_core/tree/main), [OX](https://github.com/CommunityOx/ox_core), Standalone (If ran on standalone hunger and thirst are disabled completey)
- **Dependencies:** [ox_lib](https://github.com/CommunityOx/ox_lib)
- **Preview:** [Youtube](https://youtu.be/_WwuhDGCQig)

## **Important!!**
This was made because someone leaked a HUD from a well known server (New Leaf) and uploaded it to GitHub, claiming it as their own. I made this to give people a similar styled HUD, but built from scratch with 100% web source code, no stolen code ❌ (Since theres only has compiled code, as you cannot Server D*** React/Svelte Code). I’ve already said what needs to be said, click the image below if you want to see more.
