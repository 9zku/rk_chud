## **A Modern, Lightweight HUD for Everyone (Free & Open Source)**
This is a simple hud made for fun and something to post for free, it lacks features but looks nice and good for servers going for a simple look, I haven't tested this on any resolution/aspect ratio other then 1920x1080 16:9, so it may not work on other resolutions good. 

- **Supported Frameworks:** ESX, QB, QBOX, OX, Standalone (If ran on standalone hunger and thirst are disabled completey)
- **Dependencies:** ox_lib
- **Preview:** [Youtube](https://youtu.be/_WwuhDGCQig)

## **Important!!**
This was made because someone leaked a HUD from a well known server (New Leaf) and uploaded it to GitHub, claiming it as their own. I made this to give people a similar styled HUD, but built from scratch with 100% web source code, no stolen code ❌ (Since theres only has compiled code, as you cannot Server D*** React/Svelte Code). I’ve already said what needs to be said, click the image below if you want to see more.
